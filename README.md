📌 Project Overview

The AI Tools Performance Monitoring Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize the global performance, adoption, and impact of various AI tools and models.
This dashboard provides insights into how AI technologies are being adopted worldwide and how they perform based on multiple technical and business-oriented metrics.

The project contains two fully connected pages:
	1.	Overview Page – Global AI tools performance and adoption summary
	2.	Performance Analytics Page – Detailed technical and regional performance metrics

🗂️ Dataset Information
    The dataset connects AI models, regions, performance metrics, and adoption metrics into one structure.

    Main types of data used:
1.	AI Model Information
        This part describes the AI tools themselves:

	•	Model Name (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, etc.)
	•	Developer/Company
	•	Category (LLM, Image Generation, Code AI, etc.)

This helps compare different tools and understand which companies are leading.

2.	Geographical Data
This gives global coverage:

	•	Country
	•	Region
	•	Continent (Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Oceania)

This is why your dashboard can show:
	•	Continent-wise performance
	•	Regional adoption
	•	Global AI trends

3.	Performance Metrics
These measure how good and efficient each AI tool is

4. Engagement Metrics
These simulate how users and companies interact with AI tools:

	•	Usage trends
	•	Adoption patterns
	•	Rating behavior
	•	Performance impact by region


Why this dataset is powerful:
	•	It is multi-dimensional
	•	It is fully connected
    
	•	It supports:
	•	Business Intelligence analysis
	•	AI governance dashboards
	•	Enterprise monitoring systems
	•	It looks like real industry data used by:
	•	AI product companies
	•	Cloud service providers
	•	Tech research organizations
